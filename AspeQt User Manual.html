<p class="auto-style2"><strong>AspeQt User Manual</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">AspeQt is a cross-platform, free and open source 
Atari 8-bit serial peripheral emulator. The name is an acronym for Atari serial 
peripheral emulator for Qt, Qt being the cross-platform application development 
framework used by AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You can download AspeQt from the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aspeqt/">SourceForge project page</a>.
</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt emulates various Atari 8-bit peripherals like 
disk drives and printers via a SIO2PC cable. If you are familiar with software 
like SIO2PC, APE, Atari810, AtariSlO etc., you probably won’t have any problems 
getting used to AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Even though AspeQt is not fully mature yet, it is easy 
to use and, despite its shortcomings, has many features that you may find 
useful, the highlights being:</span><br class="auto-style1" />
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Cross-platform GUI with drag and drop support</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">8 emulated disk drives with support for 512 
	bytes per sector disk images</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">High speed operation up to 6 times faster than 
	the normal speed</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Ability to use PC folders as emulated disks</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Disk image explorer for viewing and modifying 
	disk image contents</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Ability to run Atari executable without 
	messing with disc images and Doses</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Printer emulation</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Cassette image playback</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>System Requirements</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">AspeQt currently runs under Windows and Linux but 
porting to Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems shouldn’t require too 
much effort. The absolute minimums aren’t easy to tell but a modern Linux 
distribution with Qt 4.6 libraries or a Windows XP (or newer) is recommended.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Although AspeQt is reported to run on a Pentium 233 
MMX, a modem processor and a decent amount of RAM is strongly recommended for 
smooth operation. It runs fine on 64-bit CPUs.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">In order to do anything useful with AspeQt, you will 
need an Atari 8-bit computer and a SIO2PC cable. SIO2PC cable is an interface 
that connects the Atari’s serial bus to the PC’s serial port. Since many newer 
PCs lack a real serial port, you may need a UART card, or a high quality 
RS232-to-USB adapter (FTDI chip based devices were tested successfully, others 
may not work as intended) or a SIO2PC USB interface (instead of serial), If you 
opt for the later however, please note that the “AtariMax SIO2PC Universal 
Interface USB Edition” is not supported as it uses proprietary USB device 
drivers. </span></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">You can get a custom made RS232 based SIO2PC cable from
<a href="http://www.atari8warez.for-the.biz">Atari8Warez</a> or a standard RS232 
based SIO2PC interface from AtariMax.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You don’t need any real Atari disk drives or printers 
to use AspeQt.</span></p>
<p><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Installation</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1"><strong>On Windows</strong>, AspeQt comes with all 
the required DLLs in a ZIP file. Just unzip the archive to a folder and run 
aspeqt.exe. You may manually create shortcuts on your desktop, start menu and 
quick launch bar if you want. Future releases may include an installer but it 
doesn’t exist yet.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>On Linux</strong>, AspeQt comes as a gzipped 
source tarball. You will need Qt 4.6 libraries and build tools to compile. After 
installing them, please follow the instructions in compile.txt that comes in the 
tarball. Future versions may include pre-built packages for popular 
distributions but they don’t exist yet.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">If you want to use the AtariSlO backend, which is 
highly recommended if you have a real RS-232 serial port, you will need the 
AtariSlO package. Please follow the documentation that comes with that package 
to compile and install it.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">In order to be able to use AspeQt, you need to 
configure it to suit your hardware. When it’s running for the first time, a 
dialog will pop up asking you if you wish to open the configuration dialog. 
Click “Yes” to open the Options dialog. You can also access this dialog from the 
Tools/Options menu item.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">On Linux, you have to choose a serial I/O backend 
first. If you have installed the AtanSlO package and you have a RS-232 port, the 
recommended way is to use the AtariSlO backend. If you have a USB adapter or you 
don’t want to use AtariSIO for any other reason, choose the standard serial port 
backend. This is also the only available backend on Windows.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Configuring the standard serial port backend</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">First, enter a port name. On Windows, it should be 
something like COM1, COM2 etc. Check the device manager to see which one of them 
is installed. On Linux, it should be /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 etc. for RS-232 
ports or /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 etc. for USB adapters.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Next, you will have to select a handshaking method. 
The handshaking method tells AspeQt which one of the RS-232 pins is connected to 
Atari’s command line. There are 3 supported methods: RI, DSR and CTS. Check your 
SIO2PC interface’s documentation to learn which one of them is used for your 
cable.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The “High speed mode baud rate” combo box selects the 
transfer speed to be used for the high speed mode. Some OS /DOS for the Atari 
supports higher transfer speeds than the standard 19200 bits per second. Not all 
DOS /OS are capable of using 3x speed and some treat 2x as a special case for 
XF551 drives, so you may need some experimentation to find the best setting. 1x 
option is provided for unreliable connections, like when using a cheap USB 
adapter or when running AspeQt under virtualization software.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">If your serial port supports arbitrary bit rates, you 
may check the “Use non-standard” speeds check box and select a POKEY divisor to 
be used in high speed mode, the lower the divisor, the higher the speed. </span>
<br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The exact formula for the nominal speed is:</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">baudRate = clock/ (2*(divisor+7))</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Where dock is ~1,773,447 for PAL, and ~1,789,772 for 
NTSC, however, it’s not always possible to reach nominal speeds. So, 1x is 
divisor 40, 2x is divisor 16 and 3x is divisor 8. Divisor 0 is ~l26kbits/second 
and that means approximately 6x.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Please note that very few OS /DOS will be able to 
function with such high speeds. Currently the only tested software that can 
reach divisor 0 with AspeQt is the hisio OS patch. Also note that not all RS232 
ports /adapters will support arbitrary bit rates. As a final warning, some Atari 
8-bit computers have capacitors connected to their SIO lines that can interfere 
with high speed transfers. In short, speeds beyond 3x are highly experimental.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Configuring AtariSIO backend</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><em>Note: AtariSIO is available under Linux only!</em></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">After installing and running the AtariSIO module and 
making sure that you have the required permissions, you just need to enter a 
device name which should be /dev/atarisio0 under normal circumstances and select 
a handshaking method as described above for the standard serial port backend. 
Please refer to AtariSIO documentation on how to build and install AtariSIO.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">After making sure that you installed and configured 
AspeQt correctly, you can start using it with your Atari. If you used similar 
software before, it should be fairly straight forward.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Disk images</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Instead of using real disks, AspeQt uses disk images. 
These are regular files that contain an image of an Atari disk. There are 
several formats, the most common being the .atr format, currently AspeQt only 
supports .atr, .xfd,&nbsp; atx <em>(preliminary),</em> and .pro&nbsp; formats. Future releases will provide support 
for .scp, .dcm, .di and gzipped (.atz. atr.gz, .xfz and .xfd.gz) formats.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt emulates 8 disk drives. You can see one 
slot for each of them labeled Dl through DB. You can mount a disk image by:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Dragging and dropping a file to the desired 
	slot</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Using the “Disk/Mount disk image” menu item 
	(the first available slot will be used)</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Using the “Mount disk image” tool button 
	available in each slot</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Right dicking on a slot and selecting the 
	“Mount disk image” menu item</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Selecting a recently used disk image from the 
	“Disk” menu</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">By pressing Alt + 1 through Alt + 8</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="auto-style1">You can see the result of your operation in the log 
display which is below the disk slots, if the operation is completed 
successfully, your Atari should be able to see the mounted disk image just like 
a real disk in a real drive.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You can use the tool buttons and context menu items to 
perform other operations like saving the disk image, enabling write protection 
for the image, reverting the image to its last saved state, ejecting 
(unmounting) the image, creating a new image and so on. You can also swap images 
using drag and drop.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Folder images</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Folder images provide a similar function to the 
features variously named as “PC mirror’, “Simulated disk”, “Share point” etc. by 
other peripheral emulators. This is basically a simulated Atari disk. Instead of 
a disk image, you can mount a folder in your PC that contains some Atari files 
and Atari will see it as a disk with the same files in it.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Currently, the mounted folder will be seen as a 
standard DOS 2.0s disk and it’s read-only. Also, there may be some compatibility 
issues with some DOS. The folder images are not bootable. But all of these 
shortcomings may change with the future versions.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Running Atari executables</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Most Atari programs floating around on the net come as 
Atari DOS executables. These files may have .exe, .com, .xex or any other 
extension. Instead of messing with disk image software and DOS, you may directly 
run these files in your Atari using AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You can either drag and drop a file with .exe, com or 
.xex extension into any slot or you can use the menu item “File/Boot Atari 
executable” to access this feature. A dialog with the necessary instructions 
will pop up and the file will be loaded and run.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The executable booter has an optional high speed code 
which will allow you to load programs a lot faster. You can enable/disable it 
with the “Tools/Options/Emulation/Use high speed executable loader” check box. 
The high speed code is not able to cope with higher speeds than divisor 3 so 
check your configuration before attempting to load a file in this way.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Please note that this feature is not compatible with 
every executable and, in practice, it’s not even possible to implement such a 
loader. High speed loader has even more issues. So there will always be some 
programs that you won’t be able to run with the executable booter but hopefully 
the number of the compatibility problems will decrease with future versions of 
AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Image explorer</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><em>Warning: This feature is highly experimental. Use 
it at your own risk!</em></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">As mentioned above, AspeQt uses disk images instead of 
real disks. These images may contain Atari files and it’s not always easy to 
extract them from an image or to add a file into an image. By clicking the 
‘Image properties’ tool button or by using the context menu, you can explore the 
files in a mounted disk image.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">There are various file systems (ways of putting files 
in a disk) used by Atari. AspeQt supports the most common one, the Atari Dos 
file system (including the most used variants, like Dos 2.5 and MyDos) fully, 
including MyDos style subdirectories. It also has read-only support for 
SpartaDos file system. Other file systems (like Dos 3.0) are not supported at 
the moment.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">By using the tool bar buttons in the image explorer, 
you can drag and drop, extract, add, delete Atari files with optional text 
conversion. You can also drag and drop files between different images and rename 
files by pressing F2 after selecting the name or extension of a file.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Cassette images</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt can playback cassette images in .cas format. 
These are PC files that contain data extracted from an Atari cassette. You can 
either drag and drop a file with .cas extension into any slot or you can use the 
menu item “File/Playback cassette image” to access this feature. A dialog with 
the necessary instructions will pop up and the file will be played back.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The cassette emulator can be configured to ignore the 
baud rate that is embedded in the image file in favor of a custom one. This may 
speed up the load times but can cause compatibility problems. You can 
enable/disable it with the “Tools/Options/Emulation/Use custom baud rate for 
cassette emulation” check box. When enabled, you can use the spin box below to 
set the custom baud rate. The available values range from 425 through 875 bps. 
These values are the lowest and highest speeds that the Atari OS can process. 
The normal speed is 600 bps.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The cassette emulation does not support rewinding or 
seeking in the images. This may change in the future versions.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Printer output</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt emulates a generic text-only Atari printer. It 
only emulates the first printer device, that is “P1:” You can view, save or 
print the emulated printer output using the “File/View printer text output”. 
Support for ASCII and ATASCII is provided.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4">Other features</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt allows you to save and load your sessions, that 
is, the order and names of the mounted images and their settings. You can access 
this feature from the “File/Open session” and “File/Save session as” menu items.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt also implements a date/time downloader device which communicates with AspeCl (the client module of AspeQt that runs on the Atari computer).
AspeCl downloads the date/time from AspeQt and sets the same on the Atari, optionally turning the TD line ON or OFF through the use of command line switches.  AspeCl is a general purpose client module and more functionality (other than Date/Time) will be added in future releases.
</span>
</p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">AspeQt can also use
APETIME to set the date/time on the Atari computer. APETIME is available in the
APE package, in the utilities disk image. Support for APETIME however is
deprecated with the introduction of AspeCl.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
