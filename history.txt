version 0.8
    + This version introduces the AspeQt client module AspeCl. AspeCl runs on the Atari computer and serves as a client
      to AspeQt. In this release only Date/Time functionality is implemented, in future releases more
      functionality will be added. (Ray Ataergin)

            AspeCl is fully compatible with SpartaDos and SDX, and support the following command line switches:

                    TS  => Set Date/Time on Atari
                    TO  => Set Date/Time on Atari and turn TD Line ON
                    TF  => Set Date/Time on Atari and turn TD Line OFF

                         usage:  AspeCl TS|TO|TF

      With the introduction of AspeCl the use of Apetime is now deprecated. AspeQt still supports Apetime as is
      with no further development to adapt to future releases of Apetime (Ray Ataergin)
    + MainWindow SIZE is now saved and restored (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added a "Strip Line Numbers" option when saving text printer output to a PC file.

    + Disk slots now show the filename without the path.
	The directory path can be seen as a tooltip

	read the mounted file/folder names. (Ray Ataergin)

    + Remove the retry limit when waiting for a command frame  (Matthias Reichl).

    + A (cosmetic) fix for the image size calculation in the "create image" dialog (Matthias Reichl)
